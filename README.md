🔸UIDAI-Hackathon-Problem-Statement🔸
We are a team of 3, B.Tech 2nd year students, this is a project for HACKATHON 2026.

Team ID: 11817
Theme: Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates
Problem Statement: Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

🔸Objective:
🔹 Identify geographical patterns in enrolment and update activities.
🔹 Detect anomalies or inconsistencies in Aadhaar updates.
🔹 Generate actionable insights to support UIDAI in optimizing enrolment processes and improving data quality.

Identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators and translate them into clear insights or solution frameworks that can support informed decision-making and system improvements.

🔸Description:
Our project is about Data Visualization of Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates. We have used Google Colab for respective datasets given by them. We have shown meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies and displayed it with clear insights or frameworks. Effective Data Analysis has been done for the given datasets of enrollment and biometrics of users within a give age range.

🔸Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  🔹Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent district/state names.
  🔹Standardized column names and data types.
  🔹Aggregated data by district, state, age, and gender for trend analysis.

Transformations and Analysis:
  🔹Calculated total enrolments and updates per district/state.
  🔹Computed age-wise and gender-wise distribution of enrolment and update activity.
  🔹Identified districts with unusually high or low updates (potential anomalies).

Step's: 
1. Importing all the libraries
2. Loading the respective dataset-1
3. Analyzing the Data
4. Data Cleaning(Handling missing values)
5. The above 4 steps will be repated for other 2 datasets
6. Merge the given 3 datasets in each folder(After all three datasets analysis is done)
7. At last we have shown 5 graphical visualization of these datasets in each file.

Datasets Used:
🔹Aadhaar eKYC Data: Pre-existing aadhar details for users.
🔹District/Sub-district Database: Official administrative divisions in India for validation.
(All analysis is based strictly on the columns provided in the official dataset, ensuring compliance with UIDAI data usage rules.)

🔸Tools & Libraries Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Google Colab for interactive analysis

🔸Code / Notebook:
All analysis is performed in Google Colab. Code snippets and visualisations are included in the PDF submission.

🔸Conclusion / Impact
  * Generated actionable insights on regional enrolment patterns, gender-age participation, and anomaly detection.
  * Supports UIDAI in resource allocation, policy decisions, and targeted awareness campaigns.
  * Provides a baseline for predictive modeling of Aadhaar enrolment and updates in the future
